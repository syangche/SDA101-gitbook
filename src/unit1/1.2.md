# Errors and user feedback

Errors and feedback encompass the ways in which a system communicates information about errors, alerts, and user actions to the user. Clear and timely feedback helps users understand and correct errors, preventing frustration and promoting effective system usage.

## Errors:

### Slips
Silly mistakes that often occur when people aren't paying close attention to what they are doing. So while they intend to perform one action, they slip and end up doing a similar action.

**Example:** Embarrassing typos in a text message, hitting reply all. Occur when users have the right intention but make unintended actions.

### Lapses
Occur when users forget to perform a necessary action or fail to notice important information.

**Example:** Forgetting a password or forgetting the next step.

### Mistakes
Conscious errors that occur when the user's goal is inappropriate. It arises due to misunderstanding of the situation. So when people have incorrect info about the task or system and design that do not match the interface.

**Example:** Gray button, thinking it's disabled and couldn't submit the form but it was actually a design choice.

## Feedback:

1. **Visual Feedback:** 
   Visual feedback provides users with visual cues or changes in the interface to indicate the result of an action.
   
   *Example:* Highlighting a selected button, changing the color of a completed form field, or displaying a progress bar during a file upload.

2. **Auditory Feedback:** 
   Auditory feedback uses sound or audio cues to inform users about the outcome of their actions.
   
   *Example:* Playing a "ding" sound when a message is sent successfully or provides an error beep when an invalid action is attempted.

3. **Tactile Feedback:**
   Tactile feedback involves physical sensations or vibrations that provide users with a sense of confirmation or response.
   
   *Example:* Haptic feedback on touchscreens when pressing virtual buttons or vibrating notifications on mobile devices.

4. **Error Messages:** 
   Error messages are specific notifications that inform users about incorrect actions or system failures. Effective error messages should be clear, concise, and provide guidance on how to resolve the error.
   
   *Example:* Displaying an error message like "Invalid username or password. Please try again" when login credentials are incorrect.

5. **Undo/Redo:** 
   Undo and redo functionality allows users to revert or repeat actions, providing a way to recover from errors.
   
   *Example:* Providing an "Undo" button to revert a deleted item or allowing users to redo a formatting change in a document.

6. **Help and Documentation:** 
   Providing contextual help, tooltips, or access to comprehensive documentation assists users in understanding system functionality, preventing errors, and finding solutions when errors occur.
