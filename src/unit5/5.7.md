## Positioning and Z-Index

### Positioning
Use `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky` for positioning.  
Control placement with `top-`, `right-`, `bottom-`, `left-` classes.

- **Static**: No positioning is applied; they will appear in the order they are defined in the HTML.
- **Relative**: An element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
- **Absolute**: An element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position of relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky). If no such ancestor exists, it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
- **Fixed**: An element is positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
- **Sticky**: An element is treated as relative until it crosses a specified threshold (using top, right, bottom, or left), at which point it becomes fixed within its parent container.


Example:
```html
<div class="relative h-32">
  <div class="absolute top-0 right-0">Top right corner</div>
</div>
```

### Z-Index
Z-index is a CSS property used to determine the stacking order of elements that overlap. It specifies the position of an element relative to other elements on the same z-axis. Elements with a higher z-index value will appear on top of elements with a lower z-index value.

Z-index can be used to create complex visual effects, such as tooltips, pop-ups, and modal windows.

Control stacking order with `z-` classes.  
Available values include `z-0`, `z-10`, `z-20`, up to `z-50`, and `z-auto`.

Example:
```html
<div class="z-10 relative">Above normal flow</div>
