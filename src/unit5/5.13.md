# 4. Customization

One of the key advantages of shadcn/ui is its flexibility and customizability. You can easily modify the components to fit your project's needs:

- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes to adjust the appearance of components.
- **Functionality**: Modify the component's code directly to add or change features.
- **Theming**: Update the globals.css file to change the overall theme of your components.

### Example of customizing a button:
```jsx
<Button className="bg-purple-500 hover:bg-purple-600">
  Custom Purple Button
</Button>
```

# 6. Troubleshooting

### Common issues and solutions:

- **Components not styling correctly**:
  - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured in your project.
  - Check if the component's CSS file is imported correctly.

- **TypeScript errors**:
  - Make sure you have the latest types installed for React and Radix UI.
  - Verify that your tsconfig.json is correctly set up.

- **Components not working as expected**:
  - Check the shadcn/ui documentation for any specific requirements or props.
  - Ensure all required dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
