# Designing mobile navigation and menu patterns
Effective mobile navigation is crucial for a good user experience. Here are some popular patterns and considerations:

### Hamburger menu:
A widely recognized icon (â˜°) that expands to reveal navigation options.
Saves space but can hide important navigation items.

### Bottom navigation bar:
Places key navigation items at the bottom of the screen for easy thumb access.
Ideal for apps or websites with 3-5 main sections.

### Expandable menus:
Accordion-style menus that expand and collapse to show subcategories.
Helps organize complex navigation structures.

### Search-centered navigation:
Prominent search bar for content-heavy sites.
Allows users to quickly find what they're looking for.

### Progressive disclosure:
Reveal additional options or content as the user navigates deeper into the site.
Helps manage complex navigation without overwhelming the user.

### Sticky headers:
Keep important navigation elements visible as users scroll.
Ensures easy access to key functions or menu items.
