## Adaptive Web Design
Introduced in 2011 by web designer Aaron Gustafson. It has multiple fixed layout sizes. It selects the layout most appropriate for the screen. Designers don't need to worry about how elements will be arranged when screen size changes and have more control over designs. 

On the flip side, we can't create designs for all types of devices and screen sizes, and if users open a website on a screen of uncommon size, the design might not be displayed correctly. In this case, responsive design can accommodate websites on a wider range of screen sizes
