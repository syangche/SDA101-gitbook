## Microinteractions
Small, functional animations that support the user by giving visual feedback and displaying changes more clearly.  
Microinteractions contain a large number of digital elements, but not every element is part of a microinteraction. Static elements that are always present on the screen are not microinteractions because they do not have a distinct trigger. Additionally, flows composed of multiple actions are not microinteractions.

There are two types of microinteractions: **User Triggered** and **System Triggered**.

### Example:

1. **Scrollbar**  
   Gives visual feedback to the user changing location within a page (User triggered)
   
2. **Pull-to-refresh animation**  
   Gives visual feedback to a user action (User triggered)
   
3. **Swipe animation**  
   Gives visual feedback that a user has swiped an element (User triggered)

4. **Digital alarm**  
   Gives auditory (and visual) feedback to time condition being met (System triggered)
