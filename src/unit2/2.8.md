## Creating responsive layouts and fluid grids
Creating responsive layouts and fluid grids Responsive layouts and fluid grids are essential components of responsive web design. 

Here are some key points: 

**Use relative units:** Instead of fixed pixel values, use relative units like percentages, em, or rem for widths and sizes. This allows elements to scale proportionally across different screen sizes.

**Implement a grid system:** Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for creating flexible, responsive layouts. These modern CSS layout systems make it easier to create complex, responsive designs.

**Breakpoints:** Define breakpoints where your layout will change to accommodate different screen sizes. Use media queries to apply different styles at these breakpoints.

**Flexible images: Use max-width:** 100% to ensure images don't exceed their container's width. Consider using the picture element for art direction and serving different image sizes.
