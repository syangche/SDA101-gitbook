## Spacing and Layout

One of the easiest ways to clean up a design is to give every element a little more room to breathe. Proper spacing and layout can significantly improve the readability and overall aesthetic of your design.

When designing for the web, white space is almost always added to a design â€” if something looks a little too cramped, you add a bit of margin or padding until things look better.
