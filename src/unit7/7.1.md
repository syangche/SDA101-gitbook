# Introduction to Web Components

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.

## Key Features of Web Components:

- **Custom Elements**: Allow developers to create new HTML tags, extend existing HTML tags, or extend other developers' tags.

- **Shadow DOM**: Provides encapsulation for JavaScript, CSS, and templating in a Web Component. It keeps the component's internal structure separate from the main document's DOM.

- **HTML Templates**: The `<template>` and `<slot>` elements enable you to write markup templates that are not displayed in the rendered page but can be used to define the structure of a custom element.

## Benefits of Web Components:

- **Reusability**: Create components once and use them across different projects.
- **Encapsulation**: The internal workings of a component are hidden, reducing style and script conflicts.
- **Standard-based**: Built on web standards, ensuring better compatibility and longevity.
- **Framework-agnostic**: Can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.
