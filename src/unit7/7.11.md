## Combining Multiple Components; Common Design Language

### Composing Components

Web Components are designed to be composed together to build more complex user interfaces. You can nest custom elements inside one another, creating a hierarchy of components. 
```html
<my-layout>
  <my-header>
    <my-logo></my-logo>
    <my-navigation-menu></my-navigation-menu>
  </my-header>
  <my-content>
    <my-card>
      <span slot="title">Card Title</span>
      <p>Card content goes here.</p>
    </my-card>
  </my-content>
  <my-footer></my-footer>
</my-layout>
```
This composition of components helps maintain a modular and maintainable codebase.

### Common Design Language

When building a system of Web Components, it's important to establish a common design language. This includes:
- **Consistent Styling**: Use a CSS-in-JS solution or CSS variables to ensure a unified visual style across all components.

- **Shared Behavior**: Define common behaviors and interactions that are consistently applied across components.
- **Naming Conventions**: Establish a clear naming convention for your custom elements to improve discoverability and understanding.
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for each component, including its purpose, usage, and customization options.

By maintaining a common design language, you can create a cohesive and intuitive user experience, even when composing multiple Web Components together.
