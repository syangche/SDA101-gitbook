### Exercise
Build a reusable card component using web components that can display various types of content. You should have a HTML file and a JavaScript file containing your Web Component implementation.

Your card component should:

- Use a custom element with an appropriate name (following Web Components naming conventions)

- Implement shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- Include at least three different slot areas (e.g., header, content, footer)
- Support customization through both attributes and CSS custom properties (variables)
- Allow for different types of content (text, images, other HTML elements)
- Maintain consistent styling while being visually customizable

### Practice Questions:
1. Create a custom element called "toggle-button" that:
- Displays a button that toggles between ON/OFF states
- Changes color based on state (green for ON, red for OFF)
 - Dispatches a custom event called "toggle-changed" when clicked
 - Maintains its state even if the page reloads (using localStorage)

2. Create a custom element called "user-profile" that displays a user's name and role.
The element should accept "name" and "role" attributes. Style it to have a card-like appearance with a border and padding. 
- Create the UserProfile class that extends HTMLElement
- Define the custom element
- Add a template with basic styling
- Display the attribute values
