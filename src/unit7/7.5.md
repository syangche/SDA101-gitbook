## Web Components API Lifecycle Methods

Web Components have several built-in lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into different stages of the component's lifecycle:

- `connectedCallback()`: Called when the component is inserted into the DOM.
- `disconnectedCallback()`: Called when the component is removed from the DOM.
- `adoptedCallback()`: Called when the component is moved to a new document.
- `attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when an observed attribute of the component changes.

These methods allow you to perform setup, cleanup, and other actions at the appropriate times during the component's lifecycle.

## Modular Development

Web Components enable modular development by allowing you to encapsulate functionality, styles, and markup within a self-contained unit. This promotes code reuse, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

Some best practices for modular development with Web Components include:

- **Encapsulate Functionality**: Implement all the logic, styles, and markup related to a specific feature or UI element within a single custom element.

- **Separate Concerns**: Keep the component's internal implementation details hidden from the outside world, exposing only the necessary API (attributes, properties, methods).
- **Dependency Management**: Manage dependencies between components carefully to avoid conflicts and ensure predictable behavior.
- **Composability**: Design components to be composable, allowing them to be combined and nested to build more complex UIs.
