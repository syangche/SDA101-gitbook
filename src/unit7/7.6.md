## Dependency Problems; Wrapping Third-Party Libraries

### Dependency Problems

When working with Web Components, you may encounter dependency-related issues, such as:

- **Global Namespace Conflicts**: Multiple components using the same global variable or function name can lead to unintended interactions.
- **CSS Leakage**: Styles defined in one component can unintentionally "leak" into other components, causing visual issues.
- **Versioning Conflicts**: Different components relying on different versions of the same third-party library can cause compatibility problems.

### Wrapping Third-Party Libraries

To address these issues, you can wrap third-party libraries within your Web Components. This provides several benefits:

- **Encapsulation**: The component's internal implementation, including any third-party dependencies, is hidden from the outside world.
- **Versioning**: You can manage the version of the third-party library independently, without affecting other components.
- **Customization**: You can customize the third-party library's behavior, adapting it to the specific needs of your component.

**Example of wrapping a third-party library (Chart.js) within a Web Component:**
```js
class ChartComponent extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });

    // Load the Chart.js library within the component's shadow DOM
    const chartScript = document.createElement('script');
    chartScript.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js';
    this.shadowRoot.appendChild(chartScript);
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    // Wait for the Chart.js library to load before rendering the chart
    chartScript.onload = () => {
      this.renderChart();
    };
  }

  renderChart() {
    const ctx = this.shadowRoot.createElement('canvas').getContext('2d');
    new Chart(ctx, {
      type: 'bar',
      data: {
        labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow'],
        datasets: [{ data: [300, 50, 100] }]
      }
    });
  }
}

customElements.define('chart-component', ChartComponent);
```
By wrapping the third-party library within the component, you can ensure that it doesn't conflict with other components or the global namespace, and you can customize its behavior as needed.
