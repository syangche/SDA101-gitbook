## Simple Selectors

### Element Selector
Selects HTML elements based on their tag names.

### Id Selector
Targets an HTML element with a specific id attribute.

### Class Selector
Selects elements with a particular class attribute.

```css
/* element selector */
p {
    color: blue;
}

/* id selector */
#container {
    color: red;
}

/* class selector */
.intro {
    color: green;
}
```
### Universal Selector:
Used to select all the elements in an HTML document. It will be applied to each and every HTML element on the page

```css
/* universal selector */
* {
    color: purple;
}
```

### Group Selector:
It is used to style all comma-separated elements with the same style.

Suppose you want to apply common styles to different selectors, instead of writing rules separately you can write them in groups 

```css
/* grouping selector */
h2, h3 {
    color: orange;
}
```

### Attribute Selector
It is used to select the elements with a specified attribute or attribute value.

```css
/* attribute selector */
a[href] {
    color: brown;
}
```

### Pseudo-class Selector
It is used to style a special type of state of any element. 

Example: It is used to style an element when a mouse cursor hovers over it.

```css
/* pseudo-class selector*/
a:link {
    color: yellow;
}
```

### Pseudo-element Selector
It is used to style any specific part of the element. 

Example- It is used to style the first letter or the first line of any element.

```css
/* pseudo-element selector */
p::first-line {
    color: pink;
} 
```
