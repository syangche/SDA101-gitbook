## Pointer Events
Pointer events are a modern way to handle input from a variety of pointing devices, such as a mouse, a pen/stylus, a touchscreen, and more.

### Pointer Event Types
Pointer events are named similarly to mouse events:

| Pointer Event   | Similar Mouse Event |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| `pointerdown`   | `mousedown`         |
| `pointerup`     | `mouseup`           |
| `pointermove`   | `mousemove`         |
| `pointerover`   | `mouseover`         |
| `pointerout`    | `mouseout`          |
| `pointerenter`  | `mouseenter`        |
| `pointerleave`  | `mouseleave`        |
| `pointercancel` | -                   |
| `gotpointercapture` | -               |
| `lostpointercapture` | -              |

### Pointer Event Properties
Pointer events have the same properties as mouse events, such as `clientX`, `clientY`, `target`, etc., with additional properties:

- `pointerId`: Unique identifier of the pointer causing the event. Useful for handling multiple pointers (e.g., multi-touch).
- `pointerType`: Type of pointing device, can be `"mouse"`, `"pen"`, or `"touch"`.
- `isPrimary`: `true` for the primary pointer (first finger in multi-touch).

## Keydown and Keyup
The `keydown` event occurs when a key is pressed down, and `keyup` when it’s released.
```js
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  console.log('Key pressed:', event.key);
  if (event.key === 'Enter') {
    alert('Enter key pressed!');
  }
});
```

### event.code and event.key
- `event.key`: Returns the character of the key pressed.
- `event.code`: Returns the physical key code.

Example:

| Key         | `event.key`     | `event.code` |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Z           | z (lowercase)   | KeyZ         |
| Shift+Z     | Z (uppercase)   | KeyZ         |

## Scrolling
The `scroll` event allows reacting to page or element scrolling. It can be useful for:

- Showing/hiding additional controls or information based on scroll position.
- Loading more data when the user scrolls to the end of the page.
```js
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
  console.log('Scrolled to:', window.pageYOffset);
});
```
### Prevent Scrolling
You can’t prevent scrolling directly using `event.preventDefault()` in a `scroll` event listener since it triggers after the scroll has already happened.

Instead, prevent the scroll-triggering event, like `keydown` for `pageUp` or `pageDown`. Alternatively, use CSS with the `overflow` property to control scroll behavior.
