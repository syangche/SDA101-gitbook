### Exercise - Basic form validation
Implement a client-side form validation script that checks user input in real-time for a registration form. 

The form should include fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation. 

Validate each field as the user types, displaying error messages dynamically without page reload. Implement checks for username length, email format, password strength (including minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters), and password match.

Use JavaScript to handle the validation logic and DOM manipulation for displaying error messages. Additionally, disable the submit button until all fields pass validation
