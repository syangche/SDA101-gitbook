Before we dive into JavaScript, let's quickly review what an HTML form looks like:
```html
<form id="myForm">
  <input type="text" name="username" id="usernameInput">
  <input type="password" name="password" id="passwordInput">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
This creates a simple form with a text input for a username, a password input, and a submit button.

# 1. Form Properties and Methods

## Accessing Forms

JavaScript provides several ways to access forms on a webpage:

- Using `document.forms`:
```js
// Access the first form on the page
let firstForm = document.forms[0];

// Access a form by its name or id
let myForm = document.forms.myForm;
// or
let myForm = document.forms['myForm'];
```
- Using query selectors:
```js
// Using getElementById
let myForm = document.getElementById('myForm');

// Using querySelector
let myForm = document.querySelector('#myForm');
```
## Accessing Form Elements

Once you have a reference to a form, you can access its elements:

- Using the `elements` property:
```js
let form = document.forms.myForm;

// Access by name
let usernameInput = form.elements.username;

// Access by index
let passwordInput = form.elements[1];
```
- Using query selectors on the form:
```js
let usernameInput = form.querySelector('#usernameInput');
```

## Form Properties

Forms have several useful properties:

- `form.length`: Returns the number of elements in the form.
```js
console.log(form.length);  // Outputs: 3 (2 inputs + 1 button)
```
- `form.name`: Gets or sets the name of the form.
```js
console.log(form.name);  // Outputs: "myForm"
form.name = "newFormName";
```
- `form.method`: Gets or sets the HTTP method used to submit the form.
```js
console.log(form.method);  // Outputs: "get" (default)
form.method = "post";
```
- `form.action`: Gets or sets the URL where the form data will be submitted.
```js
console.log(form.action);  // Outputs: current page URL by default
form.action = "https://example.com/submit";
```

## Form Methods

Forms also have methods you can use:

- `form.submit()`: Submits the form programmatically.

- `form.reset()`: Resets all form elements to their default values.


# 2. Focus

Focus determines which element is ready to accept input from the keyboard. It's an important concept for form usability and accessibility.

## Setting Focus

You can set focus to an element using the `focus()` method:
```js
let usernameInput = document.getElementById('usernameInput');
usernameInput.focus();
```

This will move the cursor to the username input field, ready for the user to type.

## Removing Focus

To remove focus from an element, use the `blur()` method:
```js
usernameInput.blur();
```

## Checking Focus

You can check if an element has focus using the `:focus` pseudo-class in CSS, or the `document.activeElement` property in JavaScript:
```js
if (document.activeElement === usernameInput) {
  console.log('Username input has focus');
}
```


## Focus Events

There are two main focus-related events:

- `focus`: Fired when an element receives focus.
- `blur`: Fired when an element loses focus.

Example:
```js
usernameInput.addEventListener('focus', function() {
  console.log('Username input focused');
});

usernameInput.addEventListener('blur', function() {
  console.log('Username input lost focus');
});
```

# 3. Form Submission

Form submission is the process of sending form data to a server.


## The Submit Event

When a form is submitted (either by clicking a submit button or pressing Enter in a text field), it triggers a submit event. You can listen for this event to perform actions before the form is sent:
```js
form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  // Prevent the form from submitting normally
  event.preventDefault();
  
  console.log('Form is being submitted');
  
  // You can perform validation or other actions here
});
```

## Validating Form Data

Before submitting a form, you often want to check if the data is valid. Here's a simple example:
```js
form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  let username = form.elements.username.value;
  let password = form.elements.password.value;
  
  if (username.length < 3) {
    alert('Username must be at least 3 characters long');
    return;
  }
  
  if (password.length < 6) {
    alert('Password must be at least 6 characters long');
    return;
  }
  
  // If we get here, the form is valid
  console.log('Form is valid, submitting...');
  this.submit();
});
```
